NAME

Scope::Cleanup - reliably run code upon exit of dynamic scope

DESCRIPTION

This module provides a facility for automatically running cleanup code
when exiting a dynamic scope.  The cleanup code is attached to the stack
frame directly, rather than being attached to an object that must then
be managed separately.  The cleanup code reliably runs when the stack
frame unwinds, regardless of the reason for unwinding: it may be a normal
return, exception throwing, program exit, or any kind of non-local return.

Cleanup code established through this module has direct access to Perl's
dynamic state.  It can do things such as "die" to change the course of
execution outside the cleanup.
