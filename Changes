version 0.002; 2012-02-04

  * don't preserve ghost context on Perl 5.13.7 and above, where the
    core's reliance on it has supposedly been rectified

  * trigger custom op generation via Devel::CallChecker rather than by
    hooking the underlying op checker

  * include META.json in distribution

  * convert .cvsignore to .gitignore

  * add MYMETA.json to .cvsignore

version 0.001; 2010-10-24

  * bugfix: during unwinding, preserve ghost context regardless of
    its type and on all Perl versions, because there have been and are
    several things relying on it, not just the C stack unwinding control

  * update documentation to reflect Perl 5.13.1's improvement in $@
    behaviour

  * in XS, use PERL_NO_GET_CONTEXT for efficiency

  * in XS, declare "PROTOTYPES: DISABLE" to prevent automatic generation
    of unintended prototypes

  * jump through a hoop to avoid a compiler warning

  * use full stricture in test suite

  * in Build.PL, complete declaration of configure-time requirements

version 0.000; 2010-04-10

  * initial released version
